/**
 * Sample with the smallest / simplest Java program to setup and use a QUIC connection,

 * (which is a simplified version of HTTP 1, see https://medium.com/platform-engineer/evolution-of-http-69cfe6531ba0).

 * Retrieves "/" resource and safes content to file.
 * Usage: expects one argument: the address of the server, e.g. http://quicserver:4433
